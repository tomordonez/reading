I started this summary at Ch17

## Chapter 17: Icarus: What Goes up

The team is burnout after the Macintosh is launched. Andy Hertzfeld, Burrell
Smith, and Steve Wozniak leave (although he remained in the Apple II). More disagreements between Sculley and Jobs.
Jobs lack of personal relationships, inexperience with management, and
operations. Sculley is a business person without a focus in product
development. The board votes to keep Sculley and kick Jobs out.

## Chapter 18: NeXT

Steve launches NeXT and spends $100K on the logo. Then argues with its designer
about the proper placement of Steve's middle name period, and that it should be placed
under the curve of the letter P and not after the letter. Steve seeks VC
funding and underestimates the delivery of the OS. Like in the movie, it's a

## Chapter 19: Pixar

Steve buys the computer animation division of Lucas Films for $10M and calls it
Pixar. Tries to control the company and clashes with one of the founders who
ends up leaving. Also tries to sell the software/hardware as a publishing

that gives them an Academy award nomination. Now Steve has $50M of his own
money in Pixar, about more than half from selling all his Apple shares. They
layoff and Pixar is losing money. Also NeXT is not doing great. They do a Hail
Mary pass and create a short Tin Toy that wins an Academy Award.
