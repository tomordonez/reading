I started this summary at Ch17

## Chapter 17: Icarus: What Goes up

The team is burnout after the Macintosh is launched. Andy Hertzfeld, Burrell
Smith, and Steve Wozniak leave (although he remained in the Apple II). More disagreements between Sculley and Jobs.
Jobs lack of personal relationships, inexperience with management, and
operations. Sculley is a business person without a focus in product
development. The board votes to keep Sculley and kick Jobs out.

## Chapter 18: NeXT

Steve launches NeXT and spends $100K on the logo. Then argues with its designer
about the proper placement of Steve's middle name period, and that it should be placed
under the curve of the letter P and not after the letter. Steve seeks VC
funding and underestimates the delivery of the OS. Like in the movie, it's a
beautiful $6,000 black box with no OS. They start to run out of money.

## Chapter 19: Pixar

Steve buys the computer animation division of Lucas Films for $10M and calls it
Pixar. Tries to control the company and clashes with one of the founders who
ends up leaving. Also tries to sell the software/hardware as a publishing
desktop but it is too expensive. With Lasseter they create a short for SIGGRAPH
that gives them an Academy award nomination. Now Steve has $50M of his own
money in Pixar, about more than half from selling all his Apple shares. They
layoff and Pixar is losing money. Also NeXT is not doing great. They do a Hail
Mary pass and create a short Tin Toy that wins an Academy Award.

## Chapter 20: A regular guy

Steve dates Joan Baez, then tracks down his birth mother, sister, and father.
Almost marries a girlfriend. Spends more time with Lisa but they argue often.

## Chapter 21: Family man
Steve gets married, more about his relationship with his sister and daughter,
he has three kids and a bit detail about them.

## Chapter 22: Toy story
Steve negotiates with Disney to make Toy Story. There is conflict with Disney's
leadership and after completing half the movie, Pixar has to rewrite the
script. Pixar goes IPO and with Steve's 80% ownership he is worth $1.2B. They
renegotiate with Disney to make more movies and keep half the profits.

## Chapter 23: The second coming
Steve finds a way to sell NeXT to Apple.

## Chapter 24: The restoration
Steve starts to take control of Apple, they fired the CEO and almost the
entire board. Steve presents a partnership with Microsoft to have MS Office on
